# PhD-Admission-Website

A PhD Admission website built using HTML5 and Java Servlets. I have also used JQuery for form validation.

The website has two components - Applicant end and Admin end.

# Applicant-end

Applicant end deals with providing interface to the applicant for filling up the form. The applicant first registers through his/her google account using google authentication service "OAuth 2.0" and then proceeds to fill the form. The applicant provides his/her personal and educational details. The applicant also needs to upload his/her resume and SOP to complete the form submission. Once the form is successfully submitted then the applicant can view his/her details anytime in the future using the same google account with which he/she has registered.

# Admin-end

Admin end provides admin with an interface containing records of all the applicants who have successfully filled the form. The admin can apply various filters and can view specific filtered records.

Note: I have used filesystem approach for maintaining the database rather than a database management system.

# How-to-use

1. Create a web project in Eclipse or Netbeans for applicant end.
2. Put all the servlet files inside repository's Applicant-End src folder inside your web project's src folder.
3. Put all the files inside repository's Applicant-End WebContent folder inside your web project's WebContent folder.
4. Create a web project in Eclipse or Netbeans for admin end.
5. Put all the servlet files inside repository's Admin-End src folder inside your web project's src folder.
6. Put all the files inside repository's Admin-End WebContent folder inside your web project's WebContent folder.
